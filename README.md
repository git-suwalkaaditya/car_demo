# Demo of Prius in ROS/GAZEBO

This is a simulation of a Prius in [gazebo 9](http://gazebosim.org) with sensor data being published.
The car's throttle, brake, steering, and gear shifting are controlled by publishing a ROS message.
A ROS node allows driving with a gamepad or joystick.

# Video + Pictures
